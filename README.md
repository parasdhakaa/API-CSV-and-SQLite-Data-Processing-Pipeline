# API-CSV-and-SQLite-Data-Processing-Pipeline
Developed a Python-based data pipeline to fetch data from REST APIs, process and visualize student test scores, and store structured data in a SQLite database. The project also includes importing real-world customer data from CSV files into SQLite using safe, parameterized queries, implemented in Jupyter Notebook.
